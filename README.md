## Features:

1. Express.js for Robust Backend:

   Fast and Scalable: Our blog utilizes Express.js, a fast and minimal web application framework for Node.js, serving as the backbone of our MVC architecture. This ensures that your blog is not only responsive but also capable of handling a growing number of users and content.

2. Dynamic Views with Handlebars:

   Expressive Templates: The blog's frontend, represented by the "View" in MVC, is crafted using Handlebars, a powerful templating engine. This allows for the creation of dynamic and expressive views, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

3. Secure User Authentication with Bcrypt:

   Hashed Passwords: User security is my top priority. I employed the bcrypt library to hash and salt passwords, enhancing the protection of user credentials. This functionality is encapsulated within the "Model" layer of MVC, ensuring a clean and modular codebase.

4. Session Management for a Seamless Experience:

   Persistent Sessions: I implemented session management, a key aspect of the "Controller" layer in MVC, to provide a seamless user experience. Once logged in, users can navigate the blog without repeated authentication, enhancing convenience without compromising security.

5. Database Management with Sequelize:

   ORM Functionality: Representing the "Model" layer, Sequelize, a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool, is employed to interact with the database. This allows for efficient data storage, retrieval, and management, ensuring the reliability and integrity of your blog's content.

6. Intuitive Content Management: CRUD

   Create, Read, Update, Delete: The blog provides an intuitive dashboard, or "Controller" layer, for managing your content. Easily create, edit, or delete blog posts with just a few clicks. The user-friendly interface ensures that you can focus on what matters mostâ€”your content.

7. Commenting System for Engaging Conversations:

   Interact with Readers: Foster a community around your content with our built-in commenting system, an extension of the "Model" layer. Engage in meaningful conversations with your readers, creating a space for discussion and collaboration.
